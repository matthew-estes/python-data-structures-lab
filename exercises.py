# Exercise 0: Example
#
# This is a practice exercise to familiarize you with basic Python data structures.
#
# Create a list called `example_list` and append three elements to it. Print each element using a loop.
#
# Requirements:
# - The list should contain any three elements of your choice.
# - Use a loop to print each element.


# def example_list_function():
#     example_list = ["element1", "element2", "element3"]
#     for element in example_list:
#         print(element)


# # Call the function and print each element
# example_list_function()

# Exercise 1: List and Indexing
#
# Create a list named students containing at least three student names (strings).
# Assign the second student’s name to a variable named first_student.
# Assign the last student’s name to a variable named last_student.


def manage_students():
    students = ["Johnny", "Craig", "Matt", "Philip"]

    first_student = students[1]
    last_student = students[-1]

    return first_student, last_student


# Call the function and print the result
print("Exercise 1:", manage_students())

# Exercise 2: Loop and String Concatenation
#
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Create a variable named meal and assign an empty string to it.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the strings in foods and append each string to meal.

def combine_foods():
    foods = ('pizza', 'tacos', 'chicken', 'spaghetti')
    meal = ""
    
    for food in foods:
        meal += food + " "
    
    return meal

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 2:', combine_foods())
